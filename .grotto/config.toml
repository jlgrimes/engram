Fix Conch memory system - implement these 4 features in the Rust codebase at ~/projects/conch:

TASK 1 - DEDUP ON INSERT: Before storing a new memory (fact or episode), compute its embedding and check cosine similarity against existing memories. If similarity > 0.95, skip the insert (or merge by reinforcing the existing memory's strength). Add this check in conch-core/src/store.rs or lib.rs. The CLI commands (remember, remember-episode) should report when a duplicate was detected.

TASK 2 - UPSERT FACTS: When storing a fact with the same subject+relation as an existing fact, update the object instead of creating a duplicate. Add a store method like upsert_fact() that checks for existing subject+relation match first. Update the CLI to use upsert by default.

TASK 3 - TAGS/CATEGORIES: Add an optional tags field to memories. Schema change: add a 'tags' TEXT column (comma-separated or JSON array). Update MemoryRecord, store methods, CLI commands (--tags flag), and recall (--tag filter). Suggested categories: preference, decision, person, project, emotional, technical, meta.

TASK 4 - SOURCE TRACKING: Add source/context fields to memories: source (string, e.g. 'discord', 'cli', 'cron'), session_id (optional string), channel (optional string). Schema migration in init_schema(). Update all insert methods, MemoryRecord struct, CLI (--source flag, auto-detect 'cli'), export/import.

Each agent should:
- Read the existing code first (crates/conch-core/src/*.rs and crates/conch-cli/src/main.rs)
- Make surgical changes, don't rewrite everything
- Run 'cargo check' to verify compilation
- Run 'cargo test' to verify existing tests still pass
- Add new tests for the new functionality
- Keep the public API backward compatible (new fields should be Optional)"""
